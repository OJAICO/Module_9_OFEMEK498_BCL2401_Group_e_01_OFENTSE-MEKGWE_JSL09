Hey there! Welcome to my Weather and Crypto Dashboard. This dashboard is a small web app that fetches and displays weather information and cryptocurrency data. It's a cool project I've been working on as part of my journey into web development.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background**: The background of the app changes based on random nature images fetched from Unsplash API.
- **Crypto Updates**: Get the latest updates on Dogecoin, including its name, current price, highest price in the last 24 hours, and lowest price in the last 24 hours.
- **Real-time Clock**: Stay updated with the current time displayed on the dashboard.
- **Weather Display**: See the current weather condition, temperature, and city based on your geolocation.

## How to Use

1. **Background**: The app automatically sets a beautiful nature background. If there's an error fetching the image, it defaults to a lovely landscape.
2. **Crypto**: Dogecoin details are displayed in the Crypto section.
3. **Clock**: The clock keeps updating in real-time.
4. **Weather**: Your current location is used to fetch weather details.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Allow location access if prompted, so the app can fetch weather details.
4. Enjoy the dashboard!
